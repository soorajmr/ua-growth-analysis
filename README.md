# ua-growth-analysis

This is a report on the fastest-growing cities in the world, as a response to a visualisation published by The Economist. A modified version of this analysis was carried by IndiaSpend.com here: https://www.indiaspend.com/why-the-economists-ranking-of-fastest-growing-cities-is-problematic/

The Rmd file can be knitted into an html to generate the report. If you are not familiar with R Markdown, see
